This assignment went well for me. I took my time the first time around focusing on comprehension instead of time. The first round took me a little over 4 hours. I though the second time would be much shorter but took about 3 hours due to a few errors. By the last time I was able to do this in 1 hour and 45 minutes. I feel confident that I can complete my own app like this in 2 1/2 hours. A tip for others, pay attention to spacing. Ruby does not like extra spaces!


a 3-5 sentences reflection on how this went for you
